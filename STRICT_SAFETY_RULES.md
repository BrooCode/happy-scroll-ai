# 🛡️ Strict Content Safety Rules - Indian Parenting Norms

## Overview

The content moderation system now follows **STRICT Indian family values** and parenting norms. The system is designed to be **over-cautious** rather than permissive.

## Core Philosophy

**"When in doubt, mark as UNSAFE"**

Better to block borderline content than risk exposing children to anything questionable.

Includes but not limited to:

- ❌ Artistic nudity (paintings, sculptures)
- ❌ Medical/educational nudity (anatomy lessons)
- ❌ Accidental exposure
- ❌ Cartoon/animated nudity
- ❌ Silhouettes or shadows suggesting nudity

**Why:** Indian culture emphasizes modesty. Children should not be exposed to any form of nudity, regardless of context.

### 2. 🚫 Sexual Content - COMPLETELY PROHIBITED
**ANY sexual reference = UNSAFE**

Includes:
